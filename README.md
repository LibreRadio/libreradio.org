# Libre Radio website
This repository holds the source code for [libreradio.org](http://libreradio.org/).

The website is hosted on an Apache server with the directory [*public*](https://github.com/LibreRadio/libreradio.org/tree/master/public) set as the document root. It currently uses SSI (Server Side Includes) for inserting the page header and footer  into the pages, but supports PHP if that added flexibility is needed in the future.
