			<h1>Install Libre Radio database</h1>
			<p>Please note that Libre Radio database still is in early development and the architecture may change drastically before it is ready for production.</p>
			<p>A migration of the software and its accompanying database to the first stable version could turn out to be difficult. If that would be the case, we will not make a script for doing the upgrade and you may have to reinstall the program (and lose all database contents in the process). Please be aware of this before installing this unstable version of a software under development.</p>

			<h2>Download the source code</h2>
			<p>You can either <a href="https://github.com/LibreRadio/database/archive/master.zip">download the source code from GitHub</a> or do the same using Git, <code>git clone https://github.com/LibreRadio/database.git</code>.</p>

			<h2>Run the setup script</h2>
			<p>Navigate to the <code>/source</code> directory you downloaded. If you'd like to change language, you can run <code>python main.py -l ##</code> where <code>##</code> is the <a href="/documentation/meta/languages.html#database">language code</a> you want to change to.</p>
			<p>Run the setup script by typing <code>python main.py --setup</code>. You will then be prompted for database host, username and passord.</p>
			<p>The setup script will now create the database structure and save all settings in a configuration file.</p>

			<h2>Start importing your audio files</h2>
