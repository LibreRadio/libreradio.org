			<h1>Design philosophy</h1>
			<p>This is a document explaining a few of the major design considerations for Libre Radio. They should, as far is possible, be applied to components of the software suite.</p>

			<h2>Simple architecture</h2>
			<p>Each part of the Libre Radio suite should do an easily defined task, so that it without too much trouble can be replaced with a custom built program.</p>

			<h2>Encourage cooperation</h2>
			<p>The users of the software suite should, where it is possible, be encouraged to help other users. A practical example of this is integration with the <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz database</a> in order to simplify the process of cataloguing recordings.</p>
