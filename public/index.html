			<h2>Main features</h2>
			<p>Libre Radio is a software suite for radio stations, currently under development. Its goal is to provide a modern broadcasting station solutions to many its problems, including automated playout with flexible scheduling and a shared music database that is easy and quick to search while still holding lots of metadata about the recordings that can be useful when searching sore something very specific.</p>

			<p>The project is currently under development and will not be ready for production use for quite some time. You can follow our <a href="https://github.com/LibreRadio/">progress on GitHub</a>.</p>

					<h3>Flexibility</h3>
					<p>The software suite will be composed of small parts doing simple tasks and can be combined into flexible system fitting mosts situations. Every radio station is different and we don't strive to fit only one.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Ease of use</h3>
					<p>By splitting a system as complex as a radio station backbone into simpler parts, your producers don't have to be system administrators and can focus on producing high quality programming instead.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Open source</h3>
					<p>Everything in the software suite is open source and free software, which means you can run the programs however you wish, study how the programs works, modify them and distribute copies to help others.</p>
				</div>
